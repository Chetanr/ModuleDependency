### Exception and Error Handling

Exception is thrown when a trying to find the dependency of a module that is not existing.

### Limitations

1. The program currently takes into account only hardcoded modules and check for the dependencies against them.
2. The code does not read the test data from the file.
3. The code runs only once. For example, if you want to run it to find multiple dependencies, you need to re-run the code.
